	abstract = {Temporal dataset shift associated with changes in healthcare over time is a barrier to deploying machine learning-based clinical decision support systems. Algorithms that learn robust models by estimating invariant properties across time periods for domain generalization ({DG}) and unsupervised domain adaptation ({UDA}) might be suitable to proactively mitigate dataset shift. The objective was to characterize the impact of temporal dataset shift on clinical prediction models and benchmark {DG} and {UDA} algorithms on improving model robustness. In this cohort study, intensive care unit patients from the {MIMIC}-{IV} database were categorized by year groups (2008–2010, 2011–2013, 2014–2016 and 2017–2019).Tasks were predicting mortality, long length of stay, sepsis and invasive ventilation. Feedforward neural networks were used as prediction models. The baseline experiment trained models using empirical risk minimization ({ERM}) on 2008–2010 ({ERM}[08–10]) and evaluated them on subsequent year groups. {DG} experiment trained models using algorithms that estimated invariant properties using 2008–2016 and evaluated them on 2017–2019. {UDA} experiment leveraged unlabelled samples from 2017 to 2019 for unsupervised distribution matching. {DG} and {UDA} models were compared to {ERM}[08–16] models trained using 2008–2016. Main performance measures were area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve ({AUROC}), area-under-the-precision-recall curve and absolute calibration error. Threshold-based metrics including false-positives and false-negatives were used to assess the clinical impact of temporal dataset shift and its mitigation strategies. In the baseline experiments, dataset shift was most evident for sepsis prediction (maximum {AUROC} drop, 0.090; 95\% confidence interval ({CI}), 0.080–0.101). Considering a scenario of 100 consecutively admitted patients showed that {ERM}[08–10] applied to 2017–2019 was associated with one additional false-negative among 11 patients with sepsis, when compared to the model applied to 2008–2010. When compared with {ERM}[08–16], {DG} and {UDA} experiments failed to produce more robust models (range of {AUROC} difference, − 0.003 to 0.050).  In conclusion, {DG} and {UDA} failed to produce more robust models compared to {ERM} in the setting of temporal dataset shift. Alternate approaches are required to preserve model performance over time in clinical medicine.},

However, {EHR} data sampled from different population groups can easily introduce unwanted biases, rarely permit individual-level data sharing, and make the data and fitted model hardly transferable across different population groups. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages unbalanced optimal transport to facilitate the unsupervised transfer learning of {EHRs} between different population groups using a model trained in an embedded feature space. Upon deriving a theoretical bound, we find that the generalization error of our method is governed by the Wasserstein distance and unbalancedness between the source and target domains, as well as their labeling divergence, which can be used as a guide for binary classification and regression tasks. Our experiments, conducted on experimental datasets from {MIMIC}-{III} database, show that our transfer learning strategy significantly outperforms standard and machine learning transfer learning methods, with respect to accuracy and computational efficiency. Upon applying our framework to predict hospital duration for populations with different insurance plans, we finally find significant disparities across groups, suggesting our method as a potential tool to assess fairness in healthcare treatment.},

	shorttitle = {Pulmonary nodule malignancy probability},
	abstract = {Aim
This study aims to quantify the performance of the Brock model through a systematic review and meta-analysis and to clarify its overall accuracy in predicting malignant pulmonary nodules.
Materials and Methods
A systematic search was conducted in databases including the Cochrane Library, Excerpta Medica database ({EMBASE}), {MEDLINE}, Web of Science, Chinese Biological Medicine Database ({CBM}), China National Knowledge Infrastructure ({CNKI}), {VIP}, and Wanfang from their inception until May 1, 2024, to collect observational cohort studies involving the Brock model. The primary outcome was the pooled area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({ROC}) the area under curve ({AUC}) for the Brock model. Secondary outcomes included sensitivity and specificity. The metaprotocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews ({CRD}42024538163).
Results
A total of 52 studies involving 85,558 patients were included. The pooled {AUC} was 0.796 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 0.771-0.820), with a pooled sensitivity of 0.82 (95\% {CI}: 0.76-0.87) and specificity of 0.80 (95\% {CI}: 0.72-0.86). Subgroup analysis showed that the performance of the full model was significantly better than that of the simplified model (0.822, 95\% {CI}: 0.794-0.849 versus 0.687, 95\% {CI}: 0.611-0.763). The model performed excellently for pulmonary nodules with diameters of 1- to 8 mm ({AUC}: 0.927, 95\% {CI}: 0.900-0.954). However, its performance was lower in Asian populations ({AUC} = 0.741, 95\% {CI}: 0.703-0.780), solitary pulmonary nodules ({AUC} = 0.767, 95\% {CI}: 0.693-0.842), and subsolid pulmonary nodules ({AUC} = 0.747, 95\% {CI}: 0.661-0.832).
Conclusion
This meta-analysis confirms the Brock model's overall strong performance. However, the results indicate certain application limitations of the Brock model, with reduced accuracy for larger nodules ({\textgreater}15 mm), solitary pulmonary nodules, subsolid nodules, and in Asian populations.},

Through extensive experiments on fifteen publicly available datasets, we show that the {TabTransformer} outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning methods for tabular data by at least 1.0\% on mean {AUC}, and matches the performance of tree-based ensemble models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the contextual embeddings learned from {TabTransformer} are highly robust against both missing and noisy data features, and provide better interpretability. Lastly, for the semi-supervised setting we develop an unsupervised pre-training procedure to learn data-driven contextual embeddings, resulting in an average 2.1\% {AUC} lift over the state-of-the-art methods.},

The fundamental prediction task of filling in missing values of a label column based on the rest of the columns is essential for various applications as diverse as biomedical risk models, drug discovery and materials science. Although deep learning has revolutionized learning from raw data and led to numerous high-profile success stories3–5, gradient-boosted decision trees6–9 have dominated tabular data for the past 20 years. Here we present the Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network ({TabPFN}), a tabular foundation model that outperforms all previous methods on datasets with up to 10,000 samples by a wide margin, using substantially less training time. In 2.8 s, {TabPFN} outperforms an ensemble of the strongest baselines tuned for 4 h in a classification setting. As a generative transformer-based foundation model, this model also allows fine-tuning, data generation, density estimation and learning reusable embeddings. {TabPFN} is a learning algorithm that is itself learned across millions of synthetic datasets, demonstrating the power of this approach for algorithm development. By improving modelling abilities across diverse fields, {TabPFN} has the potential to accelerate scientific discovery and enhance important decision-making in various domains.},

	abstract = {In recent years, large amounts of health data, such as patient Electronic
Health Records ({EHR}), are becoming readily available. This provides an
unprecedented opportunity for knowledge discovery and data mining algorithms to
dig insights from them, which can, later on, be helpful to the improvement of
the quality of care delivery. Predictive modeling of clinical risks, including
in-hospital mortality, hospital readmission, chronic disease onset, condition
exacerbation, etc., from patient {EHR}, is one of the health data analytic
problems that attract lots of the interests. The reason is not only because the
problem is important in clinical settings, but also is challenging when working
with {EHR} such as sparsity, irregularity, temporality, etc. Different from
applications in other domains such as computer vision and natural language
processing, the data samples in medicine (patients) are relatively limited,
which creates lots of troubles for building effective predictive models,
especially for complicated ones such as deep learning. In this paper, we propose
{MetaPred}, a meta-learning framework for clinical risk prediction from
longitudinal patient {EHR}. In particular, in order to predict the target risk
with limited data samples, we train a meta-learner from a set of related risk
prediction tasks which learns how a good predictor is trained. The meta-learned
can then be directly used in target risk prediction, and the limited available
samples in the target domain can be used for further fine-tuning the model
performance. The effectiveness of {MetaPred} is tested on a real patient {EHR}
repository from Oregon Health \& Science University. We are able to
demonstrate that with Convolutional Neural Network ({CNN}) and Recurrent Neural
Network ({RNN}) as base predictors, {MetaPred} can achieve much better performance
for predicting target risk with low resources comparing with the predictor
trained on the limited samples available for this risk alone.},

	abstract = {Background There is interest in using convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) to analyze medical imaging to provide computer-aided diagnosis ({CAD}). Recent work has suggested that image classification {CNNs} may not generalize to new data as well as previously believed. We assessed how well {CNNs} generalized across three hospital systems for a simulated pneumonia screening task. Methods and findings A cross-sectional design with multiple model training cohorts was used to evaluate model generalizability to external sites using split-sample validation. A total of 158,323 chest radiographs were drawn from three institutions: National Institutes of Health Clinical Center ({NIH}; 112,120 from 30,805 patients), Mount Sinai Hospital ({MSH}; 42,396 from 12,904 patients), and Indiana University Network for Patient Care ({IU}; 3,807 from 3,683 patients). These patient populations had an age mean ({SD}) of 46.9 years (16.6), 63.2 years (16.5), and 49.6 years (17) with a female percentage of 43.5\%, 44.8\%, and 57.3\%, respectively. We assessed individual models using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUC}) for radiographic findings consistent with pneumonia and compared performance on different test sets with {DeLong}’s test. The prevalence of pneumonia was high enough at {MSH} (34.2\%) relative to {NIH} and {IU} (1.2\% and 1.0\%) that merely sorting by hospital system achieved an {AUC} of 0.861 (95\% {CI} 0.855–0.866) on the joint {MSH}–{NIH} dataset. Models trained on data from either {NIH} or {MSH} had equivalent performance on {IU} (P values 0.580 and 0.273, respectively) and inferior performance on data from each other relative to an internal test set (i.e., new data from within the hospital system used for training data; P values both {\textless}0.001). The highest internal performance was achieved by combining training and test data from {MSH} and {NIH} ({AUC} 0.931, 95\% {CI} 0.927–0.936), but this model demonstrated significantly lower external performance at {IU} ({AUC} 0.815, 95\% {CI} 0.745–0.885, P = 0.001). To test the effect of pooling data from sites with disparate pneumonia prevalence, we used stratified subsampling to generate {MSH}–{NIH} cohorts that only differed in disease prevalence between training data sites. When both training data sites had the same pneumonia prevalence, the model performed consistently on external {IU} data (P = 0.88). When a 10-fold difference in pneumonia rate was introduced between sites, internal test performance improved compared to the balanced model (10× {MSH} risk P {\textless} 0.001; 10× {NIH} P = 0.002), but this outperformance failed to generalize to {IU} ({MSH} 10× P {\textless} 0.001; {NIH} 10× P = 0.027). {CNNs} were able to directly detect hospital system of a radiograph for 99.95\% {NIH} (22,050/22,062) and 99.98\% {MSH} (8,386/8,388) radiographs. The primary limitation of our approach and the available public data is that we cannot fully assess what other factors might be contributing to hospital system–specific biases. Conclusion Pneumonia-screening {CNNs} achieved better internal than external performance in 3 out of 5 natural comparisons. When models were trained on pooled data from sites with different pneumonia prevalence, they performed better on new pooled data from these sites but not on external data. {CNNs} robustly identified hospital system and department within a hospital, which can have large differences in disease burden and may confound predictions.},

The prediction model provides directions for the treatment of pulmonary nodules. Many studies have established predictive models for pulmonary nodules in different populations. However, the predictive factors contained in each model were significantly different.

In the present study, we compared four widely used and well-known mathematical prediction models., Materials and methods: We performed a retrospective study of 496 patients from January 2017 to October 2019, they were diagnosed with nodules by pathological. We evaluate models’ performance by viewing 425 malignant and 71 benign patients’ computed tomography results. At the same time, we use the calibration curve and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve whose abbreviation is {AUC} to assess one model’s predictive performance., Results: We find that in distinguishing the Benign and the Malignancy, Peking University People’s Hospital model possessed excellent performance ({AUC} = 0.63), as well as differentiating between early and late lung cancers ({AUC} = 0.67) and identifying lung adenocarcinoma ({AUC} = 0.61). While in the identification of lung squamous cell carcinoma, the Veterans Affairs model performed the best ({AUC} = 0.69)., Conclusions: Geographic disparities are an extremely important influence factors, and which clinical features contained in the mathematical prediction model are the key to affect the precision and accuracy.},

{OBJECTIVE}: To obtain an external validation of the prediction model according to Swensen and colleagues, and to quantify the potential added value of {FDG}-{PET} scanning as a function of its operating characteristics in relation to this prediction model, in a population of patients with radiologically indeterminate pulmonary nodules.
{DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PATIENTS}: Between August 1997 and March 2001, all patients with an indeterminate solitary pulmonary nodule who had been referred for {FDG}-{PET} scanning were retrospectively identified from the database of the {PET} center at the {VU} University Medical Center.
{RESULTS}: One hundred six patients were eligible for the study, and 61 patients (57\%) proved to have malignant nodules. The goodness-of-fit statistic for the model (according to Swensen) indicated that the observed proportion of malignancies did not differ from the predicted proportion (p = 0.46). {PET} scan results, which were classified using the 4-point intensity scale reading, yielded an area under the evaluated receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.77 to 0.91). The estimated difference of 0.095 (95\% {CI}, -0.003 to 0.193) between the {PET} scan results classified using the 4-point intensity scale reading and the area under the curve ({AUC}) from the Swensen prediction was not significant (p = 0.058). The {PET} scan results, when added to the predicted probability calculated by the Swensen model, improves the {AUC} by 13.6\% (95\% {CI}, 6 to 21; p = 0.0003).
{CONCLUSION}: The clinical prediction model of Swensen et al was proven to have external validity. However, especially in the lower range of its estimates, the model may underestimate the actual probability of malignancy. The combination of visually read {FDG}-{PET} scans and pretest factors appears to yield the best accuracy.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Clinical prediction models assess the likelihood of malignancy in pulmonary nodules detected by computed tomography ({CT}). This study aimed to validate four such models in a {UK} population of patients with pulmonary nodules. Three models used clinical and {CT} characteristics to predict risk (Mayo Clinic, Veterans Association, Brock University) with a fourth model (Herder et al. [4]) additionally incorporating 18Fluorine-Fluorodeoxyglucose ({FDG}) avidity on positron emission tomography–computed tomography ({PET}–{CT}).
Materials and methods
The likelihood of malignancy was calculated for patients with pulmonary nodules (4–30mm diameter) and data used to calculate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUC}) for each model. The models were used in a restricted cohort of patients based on each model's exclusion criteria and in the total cohort of all patients.
Results
Two hundred and forty-four patients were studied, of whom 139 underwent {FDG} {PET}–{CT}. Ninety-nine (40.6\%) patients were subsequently confirmed to have malignant nodules (33.2\% primary lung cancer, 7.4\% metastatic disease). The Mayo and Brock models performed similarly ({AUC} 0.895 and 0.902 respectively) and both were significantly better than the Veterans Association model ({AUC} 0.735, p{\textless}0.001 and p=0.002 respectively). In patients undergoing {FDG} {PET}–{CT}, the Herder model had significantly higher accuracy than the other three models ({AUC} 0.924). When the models were tested on all patients in the cohort (i.e. including those outside the original model inclusion criteria) {AUC} values were reduced, yet remained high especially for the Herder model ({AUC} 0.916). For sub-centimetre nodules, {AUC} values for the Mayo and Brock models were 0.788 and 0.852 respectively.
Conclusions
The Mayo and Brock models showed good accuracy for determining likelihood of malignancy in nodules detected on {CT} scan. In patients undergoing {FDG} {PET}–{CT} for nodule evaluation, the highest accuracy was seen for the model described by Herder et al. incorporating {FDG} avidity.},

While three of the models (Mayo Clinic, Veterans Association [{VA}], and Brock University) are based on clinical and computed tomography ({CT}) characteristics, one model (Herder) additionally includes the 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ({FDG}) uptake value among the positron emission tomography ({PET}) characteristics. This study aimed to compare the predictive power of these four models in the context of a population drawn from a single center in an endemic area for tuberculosis in Korea. Methods A retrospective analysis of 242 pathologically confirmed nodules (4–30 mm in diameter) in 242 patients from January 2015 to December 2015 was performed. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUC}) was used to assess the predictive performance with respect to malignancy. Results Of 242 nodules, 187 (77.2\%) were malignant and 55 (22.8\%) were benign, with tuberculosis granuloma being the most common type of benign nodule (23/55). {PET} was performed for 227 nodules (93.8\%). The Mayo, {VA}, and Brock models showed similar predictive performance for malignant nodules ({AUC}: 0.6145, 0.6042 and 0.6820, respectively). The performance of the Herder model ({AUC}: 0.5567) was not significantly different from that of the Mayo (vs. Herder, p = 0.576) or {VA} models (vs. Herder, p = 0.999), and there were no differences among the three models in determining the probability of malignancy of pulmonary nodules. However, compared with the Brock model, the Herder model showed a significantly lower ability to predict malignancy (adjusted p = 0.0132). Conclusions In our study, the Herder model including the 18FDG uptake value did not perform better than the other models in predicting malignant nodules, suggesting the limited utility of adding {PET}/{CT} data to models predicting malignancy in populations within endemic areas for benign inflammatory nodules, such as tuberculosis.},

Radiomics—the extraction and analysis of quantitative features from imaging—can identify additional imaging characteristics that cannot be seen by the eye. These features can potentially be used to diagnose cancer, identify mutations, and predict prognosis in an accurate and noninvasive fashion. This article provides insights about trends in radiomics of lung cancer and challenges to widespread adoption.{CONCLUSION}. Radiomic studies are currently limited to a small number of cancer types. Its application across various centers are nonstandardized, leading to difficulties in comparing and generalizing results. The tools available to apply radiomics are specialized and limited in scope, blunting widespread use and clinical integration in the general population. Increasing the number of multicenter studies and consortiums and inclusion of radiomics in resident training will bring more attention and clarity to the growing field of radiomics.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: The aim of this study was to compare classification results from four major risk prediction models in a wide population of incidentally detected solitary pulmonary nodules ({SPNs}) which were selected to crossmatch inclusion criteria for the selected models.
{METHODS}: A total of 285 solitary pulmonary nodules with a definitive diagnosis were evaluated by means of four major risk assessment models developed from non-screening populations, namely the Mayo, Gurney, {PKUPH} and {BIMC} models. Accuracy was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) area under the curve ({AUC}) analysis. Each model's fitness to provide reliable help in decision analysis was primarily assessed by adopting a surgical threshold of 65 \% and an observation threshold of 5 \% as suggested by {ACCP} guidelines.
{RESULTS}: {ROC} {AUC} values, false positives, false negatives and indeterminate nodules were respectively 0.775, 3, 8, 227 (Mayo); 0.794, 41, 6, 125 (Gurney); 0.889, 42, 0, 144 ({PKUPH}); 0.898, 16, 0, 118 ({BIMC}).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Resultant data suggests that the {BIMC} model may be of greater help than Mayo, Gurney and {PKUPH} models in preoperative {SPN} characterization when using {ACCP} risk thresholds because of overall better accuracy and smaller numbers of indeterminate nodules and false positive results.
{KEY} {POINTS}: • The {BIMC} and {PKUPH} models offer better characterization than older prediction models • Both the {PKUPH} and {BIMC} models completely avoided false negative results • The Mayo model suffers from a large number of indeterminate results.},

	abstract = {Computed tomography ({CT}) examinations are commonly used to predict lung nodule malignancy in patients, which are shown to improve noninvasive early diagnosis of lung cancer. It remains challenging for computational approaches to achieve performance comparable to experienced radiologists. Here we present {NoduleX}, a systematic approach to predict lung nodule malignancy from {CT} data, based on deep learning convolutional neural networks ({CNN}). For training and validation, we analyze {\textgreater}1000 lung nodules in images from the {LIDC}/{IDRI} cohort. All nodules were identified and classified by four experienced thoracic radiologists who participated in the {LIDC} project. {NoduleX} achieves high accuracy for nodule malignancy classification, with an {AUC} of {\textasciitilde}0.99. This is commensurate with the analysis of the dataset by experienced radiologists. Our approach, {NoduleX}, provides an effective framework for highly accurate nodule malignancy prediction with the model trained on a large patient population. Our results are replicable with software available at http://bioinformatics.astate.edu/{NoduleX}.},

	abstract = {With an estimated 160,000 deaths in 2018, lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the United States1. Lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography has been shown to reduce mortality by 20-43\% and is now included in {US} screening guidelines1-6. Existing challenges include inter-grader variability and high false-positive and false-negative rates7-10. We propose a deep learning algorithm that uses a patient's current and prior computed tomography volumes to predict the risk of lung cancer. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art performance (94.4\% area under the curve) on 6,716 National Lung Cancer Screening Trial cases, and performs similarly on an independent clinical validation set of 1,139 cases. We conducted two reader studies. When prior computed tomography imaging was not available, our model outperformed all six radiologists with absolute reductions of 11\% in false positives and 5\% in false negatives. Where prior computed tomography imaging was available, the model performance was on-par with the same radiologists. This creates an opportunity to optimize the screening process via computer assistance and automation. While the vast majority of patients remain unscreened, we show the potential for deep learning models to increase the accuracy, consistency and adoption of lung cancer screening worldwide.},

	abstract = {To predict lung nodule malignancy with a high sensitivity and specificity for low dose {CT} ({LDCT}) lung cancer screening, we propose a fusion algorithm that combines handcrafted features ({HF}) into the features learned at the output layer of a 3D deep convolutional neural network ({CNN}). First, we extracted twenty-nine handcrafted features, including nine intensity features, eight geometric features, and twelve texture features based on grey-level co-occurrence matrix ({GLCM}) averaged from five grey levels, four distances and thirteen directions. We then trained 3D {CNNs} modified from three 2D {CNN} architectures ({AlexNet}, {VGG}-16 Net and Multi-crop Net) to extract the {CNN} features learned at the output layer. For each 3D {CNN}, the {CNN} features combined with the 29 handcrafted features were used as the input for the support vector machine ({SVM}) coupled with the sequential forward feature selection ({SFS}) method to select the optimal feature subset and construct the classifiers. The fusion algorithm takes full advantage of the handcrafted features and the highest level {CNN} features learned at the output layer. It can overcome the disadvantage of the handcrafted features that may not fully reflect the unique characteristics of a particular lesion by combining the intrinsic {CNN} features. Meanwhile, it also alleviates the requirement of a large scale annotated dataset for the {CNNs} based on the complementary of handcrafted features. The patient cohort includes 431 malignant nodules and 795 benign nodules extracted from the {LIDC}/{IDRI} database. For each investigated {CNN} architecture, the proposed fusion algorithm achieved the highest {AUC}, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity scores among all competitive classification models.},

	abstract = {Early detection of heart failure ({HF}) can provide patients with the opportunity for more timely intervention and better disease management, as well as efficient use of healthcare resources. Recent machine learning ({ML}) methods have shown promising performance on diagnostic prediction using temporal sequences from electronic health records ({EHRs}). In practice, however, these models may not generalize to other populations due to dataset shift. Shifts in datasets can be attributed to a range of factors such as variations in demographics, data management methods, and healthcare delivery patterns. In this paper, we use unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation methods to adaptively reduce the impact of dataset shift on cross-institutional transfer performance. The proposed framework is validated on a next-visit {HF} onset prediction task using a {BERT}-style Transformer-based language model pre-trained with a masked language modeling ({MLM}) task. Our model empirically demonstrates superior prediction performance relative to non-adversarial baselines in both transfer directions on two different clinical event sequence data sources.},

\begin{abstract}
Medical AI systems face persistent challenges due to limited data, class imbalance, and inter-institutional heterogeneity. In particular, small sample sizes and skewed class distributions are common in clinical datasets, often introducing biases and undermining model reliability. Furthermore, models trained in one hospital or cohort frequently underperform when deployed at a different site, as differences in equipment, protocols, and patient demographics lead to domain shift. To address these issues, we propose a novel cross-domain adaptation framework that integrates a pre-trained Transformer-based foundation model with a classic domain alignment technique, Transfer Component Analysis (TCA). This approach leverages the rich representational power of Transformer models (pre-trained on large tabular data) and the distribution-matching capability of TCA to improve generalization under small-sample conditions. We validated our method on structured clinical datasets from two independent hospitals (295 patients in Hospital A for training, 190 patients in Hospital B for testing), focusing on malignant vs. benign pulmonary nodule classification. Our model achieved high area under the ROC curve (AUC) along with improved sensitivity and specificity on the external test set, outperforming several conventional domain adaptation baselines. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves robust cross-domain prediction by aligning feature distributions and learning generalizable classification functions over structured clinical data. Interpretation: By effectively combating data scarcity and shift, the model exhibits strong generalizability and shows potential for reliable deployment in multi-center medical settings.

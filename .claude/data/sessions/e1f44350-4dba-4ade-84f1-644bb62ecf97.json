PANDA\nintegrates a pre-trained Transformer model with Transfer Component Analysis to tackle feature repre-\nsentation and distribution shifts in small-sample scenarios. It excels in cross-institutional pulmonary\nnodule cohorts, demonstrating improved generalization with limited data. PANDA is benchmarked\nagainst traditional machine learning models and clinical scoring systems, showcasing its stability and\npractical utility in real-world multi-center applications."

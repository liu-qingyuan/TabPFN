The paired heatmaps and ROC curves show that a TabPFN-\nstyle encoder augmented with TCA delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both intra- and\ncross-hospital evaluations (AUC 0.829 \u2192 0.705). This empirically validates the feasibility of com-\nbining tabular foundation models with unsupervised domain alignment, extending recent small-data\nevidence [5] and reinforcing the foundation-model view that large-scale priors can be transferred to\nconstrained clinical cohorts [4].\nGeneralization beyond pulmonary nodules. Because the architecture operates on generic clin-\nical tokens and the adaptation layer only requires unlabeled target data, PANDA\u2019s formulation is\nnot tied to lung cancer. The demonstrated robustness under severe class imbalance suggests similar\nbenefits for other rare-disease registries or even non-medical small-sample problems where annotated\ndata are scarce, highlighting wider AI relevance.\nEfficiency and scalability. Feature-selection curves (Figure 3c) indicate that, once distilled to\neight variables, training a fold completes within seconds. This mirrors TabPFN\u2019s hallmark ability\nto replace hours of hyper-parameter search with a single forward pass [5]. Pre-training therefore\namortizes optimization cost, while the fixed encoder + TCA workflow scales to additional hospitals\nwithout end-to-end retraining, offering a pragmatic blueprint for multi-site deployments.\nInterpretability and transparency. The final model exposes attention maps and permutation\nimportances for the retained features, aligning with explainable feature-selection principles [12] and\nattention-based tabular models such as TabNet [1]. Clinicians can inspect why upper-lobe location,\nNSE, and ventilatory metrics drive predictions, meeting the AI community\u2019s push for transparent yet\naccurate models.\nTaken together, the TCA-enhanced tabular foundation model demonstrated robust external per-\nformance and outperformed both machine learning and clinical baselines, validating its potential for\nreliable deployment in real-world multi-center settings.",

Comprehensive Clinical Validation Framework: We establish a rigorous multi-institutional\nevaluation protocol using real-world data from two major cancer centers, demonstrating not only\nsuperior predictive performance (AUC 0.709, sensitivity 94.4%) but also clinical utility through\ncalibration analysis and decision curve evaluation. Our validation approach sets new standards\nfor evaluating cross-institutional medical AI systems.\n\n\u8fd9\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u5220\u9664\u4e86",
